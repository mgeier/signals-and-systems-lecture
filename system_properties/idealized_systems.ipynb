    "\n",
    "Idealized systems are systems with idealized properties that typically render their practical implementation infeasible. They play an important role in various fields of signal processing as they allow a convenient formulation of concepts and principles. In the following, the ideal low-pass is introduced as prototype for an idealized frequency selective system. Other frequency selective system can be deduced directly from this prototype."

In conclusion, the ideal low-pass in not a realizable system. The ideal low-pass can only be approximated in practical systems.
