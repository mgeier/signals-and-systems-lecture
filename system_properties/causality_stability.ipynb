    "The [principle of causality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality) states that an effect has to follow its cause temporally. Theoretical systems may violate this fundamental principle which limits their practical applicability. Causality is hence an important aspect for the practical realization of systems. Conditions for the impulse response of a linear time-invariant (LTI) causal system as well as for its transfer function are derived in this section."
