By inspection of above formula for the computation of the impulse response from the coefficients of a linear difference equation it becomes clear that the impulse response $h[k]$ for time-instant $k$ depends on the impulse response of past time instants $(k-1) \\dots (k-N+1)$. This feedback generally results in an impulse response of infinite length. Such an impulse response is commonly termed as [infinite impulse response (IIR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_impulse_response). The term IIR (system) is used synonymously to recursive system. The former relates to the length of the impulse response and the latter to the structure of the system.\n",
