    "The relation between input $x[k]$ and output $y[k] = \\mathcal{H} \\{ x[k] \\}$ of a discrete system can be described by relating actual and past samples of the input and output signal to each other. When restricting the relation to a linear superposition of these, this results in a [linear difference equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_difference_equation). The relation of difference equations to [linear time-invariant (LTI) systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTI_system_theory) is discussed in the following."

For a unique solution of the difference equation, $N$ initial conditions are required.
