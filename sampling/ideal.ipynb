    "## Ideal Sampling and Reconstruction\n",
    "\n",
    "[Digital signal processors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processor) and general purpose processors can only perform arithmetic operations within a limited number range. So far we considered continuous signals which are continuous with respect to time and its amplitude values. Such signals cannot be handled by processors in a straightforward manner. In order to obtain a digital representation of a continuous signal, a discretization has to be perfomed in both time and amplitude. The former is known as [*sampling*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_%28signal_processing%29), the latter as [*quantization*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization_%28signal_processing%29). Sampling refers to the process of picking amplitude values from a continuous signal at discrete time-instants. The sampled signal is referred to as *discrete signal*. Quantization refers to the process of mapping a continuous amplitude to a countable set of amplitude values. The quantized signal is referred to as *quantized signal*. A signal which is discrete and quantized is a *digital signal*. This is illustrated in the following\n",

    "A continuous signal $x(t)$ is sampled by taking its amplitude values at given time-instants. These time-instants can be chosen arbitrary in time, but most common are equidistant sampling schemes. The process of sampling is modeled by multiplying the continuous signal with a series of Dirac impulses. This constitutes an idealized model since Dirac impulses cannot be realized in practice.\n",

It becomes evident from above discussion of ideal reconstruction that the amplitude values are reconstructed correctly at the time-instants $k T$.
