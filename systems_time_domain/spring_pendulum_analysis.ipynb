    "## Analysis of a Damped Spring Pendulum\n",
    "\n",
    "The damped [spring pendulum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_pendulum) is an example for a physical system that can be modeled by a linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) with constant coefficients. In view of the theory of signals and systems it hence can be interpreted as a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. The mechanical properties of the damped spring pendulum are analyzed by using the theory of LTI systems. The underlying mechanical setup is depicted in the following\n",

    "A rigid body of mass $m$ is hanging on a spring with stiffness $k$ connected to a wall. A damper with viscous damping coefficient $c$ is mounted parallel to the spring to model the friction present in the system. It is assumed that the movement of the mass over time is restricted to the vertical axis, here denoted by $y$. It is assumed that the mass is in its idle position for $t<0$. The pretension of the spring by the mass can be neglected this way. It is furthermore assumed that the mass is not moving for $t<0$. Denoting the displacement of the mass over time with $y(t)$, these initial conditions are formulated as $y(t) = 0$ and $\\frac{d y(t)}{dt} = 0$ for $t<0$.\n",
