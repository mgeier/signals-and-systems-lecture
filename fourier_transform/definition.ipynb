    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "X(j \\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(t) \\, e^{-j \\omega t} \\; dt\n",

    "\n",
    "where $X(j \\omega) = \\mathcal{F} \\{ x(t) \\}$ denotes the Fourier transform of $x(t)$. It is also termed as *spectrum* of the signal $x(t)$. The argument $j \\omega$ copes for the fact that the kernel $e^{-j \\omega t}$ of above [integral transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_transform) is a [harmonic exponential signal](../continuous_signals/standard_signals.ipynb#Complex-Exponential-Signal) $e^{-s t}$ with $s= j \\omega$. Other common definitions of the Fourier transform may be found in the literature. They differ with respect to the sign of the exponential function and normalization factors. Or the Fourier transform is evaluated in terms of the frequency $f$ instead of the angular frequency $\\omega = 2 \\pi f$. In both cases, the properties, theorems and transforms may differ from the ones given here.\n",

    "### Relation to the Laplace Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "The Laplace transform $X(s) = \\mathcal{L} \\{ x(t) \\}$ of a signal $x(t)$ can be related to its Fourier transform $X(j \\omega) = \\mathcal{F} \\{ x(t) \\}$ by inspecting the kernels of both transforms. The [Laplace transform](../laplace_transform/definition.ipynb) has the complex exponential function $e^{- s t}$ with $s \\in \\mathbb{C}$ as kernel. The Fourier transform, as introduced above, has the harmonic exponential function $e^{- j \\omega t}$ with $\\omega \\in \\mathbb{R}$ as kernel. Both can be related to each other by considering that $s = \\sigma + j \\omega$. Hence, if the ROC includes the imaginary axis $s = j \\omega$ of the $s$-plane, the Fourier transform of a signal $x(t)$ can be derived from its Laplace transform by\n",

If the ROC includes the imaginary axis $s = j \\omega$ and the integration path of the inverse Laplace transform is chosen along the imaginary axis $\\sigma = 0$, the inverse Laplace transform becomes identical to the inverse Fourier transform.\n",
    "\n",
    "A benefit of the Laplace over the Fourier transform is that it exists for a wider class of signals. The one-sided Laplace transform also allows to conveniently consider initial values of differential equations."

    "### Interpretation of the Spectrum\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fourier transform is in general complex valued, $X(j \\omega) \\in \\mathbb{C}$. It is commonly represented by its real and imaginary part $X(j \\omega) = \\Re \\{ X(j \\omega) \\} + j \\cdot \\Im \\{ X(j \\omega) \\}$ or by its magnitude and phase $X(j \\omega) = |X(j \\omega)| \\cdot e^{j \\varphi(j \\omega)}$. It can be concluded from the inverse Fourier transformation that a signal $x(t)$ for which the Fourier transform $X(j \\omega)$ exists can be represented as a superposition of weighted harmonic exponential signals $X(j \\omega) \\cdot e^{j \\omega t}$. The magnitude spectra $|X(\\omega)|$ provides insights into the composition of an unknown signal in terms of its harmonic contributions. The angular frequency of these contributions can be related to the frequency by $f = \\frac{\\omega}{2 \\pi}$. Due to this reasoning, the Fourier transformation is a valuable tool in the analysis of signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general a spectrum $X(j \\omega)$ will also have non-negative contributions for negative angular frequencies $\\omega < 0$. The concept of [negative frequencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_frequency) has no physical meaning. However, in the context of the Fourier transformation with its complex kernel $e^{j \\omega t}$ it is required to express real-valued signals."
