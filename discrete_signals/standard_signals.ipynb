    "## Standard Signals\n",
    "\n",
    "A discrete signal $x[k] \\in \\mathbb{C}$ is a sequence of values that depends on the discrete index $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. It may have been derived by [sampling](../sampling/ideal.ipynb) $x[k] := x(k T)$ from a continuous signal $x(t)$. As for the case of continuous signals, certain [standard signals](../continuous_signals/standard_signals.ipynb) play an important role in the theory and practical application of discrete signals and systems. These standard signals are introduced and illustrated in the following. Some of the signals are derived by sampling their continuous counterparts, some of them by postulating equivalent properties. Discrete signals are commonly denoted by using square brackets for their arguments."
