    "The discrete Fourier transformation (DFT) can be implemented computationally very efficiently by the [fast Fourier transform (FFT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform). Various algorithms have been developed for the FFT resulting in various levels of computational efficiency for a wide range of DFT lengths. The concept of the so called [radix-2 Cooley–Tukey algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooley%E2%80%93Tukey_FFT_algorithm) is introduced in the following."

    "It follows from the last equality that the DFT can be decomposed into two DFTs $X_1[\\mu]$ and $X_2[\\mu]$ of length $\\frac{N}{2}$ operating on the even and odd indexes of the signal $x[k]$. The decomposed DFT requires $2 \\cdot (\\frac{N}{2})^2 + N$ complex multiplications and $2 \\cdot \\frac{N}{2} \\cdot (\\frac{N}{2} -1) + N$ complex additions. For a length $N = 2^w$ with $w \\in \\mathbb{N}$ which is a power of two this principle can be applied recursively till a DFT of length $2$ is reached. This comprises then the radix-2 DIT algorithm. It requires $\\frac{N}{2} \\log_2 N$ complex multiplications and $N \\log_2 N$ complex additions. The numerical complexity of the FFT algorithm scales consequently on the order of $\\mathcal{O} (N \\log_2 N)$. The notation DIT is due to the fact that the decomposition is performed with respect to the (time-domain) signal $x[k]$ and not its spectrum $X[\\mu]$.\n",

Similar and other principles can be applied to derive efficient algorithms for various other cases. A wide variety of implemented FFTs is available for many hardware platforms. Their computational efficiency depends heavily on the particular algorithm and hardware used. In the following the performance of the [`numpy.fft`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.fft.fft.html#numpy.fft.fft) function is evaluated by comparing the execution times of a [DFT realized by matrix/vector multiplication](definition.ipynb#Matrix/Vector-Representation) with the FFT algorithm.
