    "Inspection of the definition of the inverse DFT reveals, that a discrete signal $x[k]$ of finite length can be represented as a superposition of weighted harmonic exponential signals $z^k$ with the complex frequencies $z = e^{j \\mu \\frac{2 \\pi}{N}}$ for $\\mu = 0, 1, \\dots, N-1$. The corresponding normalized angular frequencies of the exponential signal are given as $\\Omega = \\mu \\frac{2 \\pi}{N}$. In the following, the complex frequencies $z$ are illustrated in the $z$-plane for the case of an even ($N=10$) and odd length ($N=11$) of the DFT\n",
    "\n",
    "![Complex frequencies of DFT kernel](sampling_unit_circle.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution of the complex frequencies in the $z$-plane is different for an even or odd length of the DFT. Only in the case of an even length, the normalized frequency $\\Omega = \\pi$ is included. For a further interpretetation of the discrete frequency $\\mu$, the link between the DFT and the DTFT is used. The DFT $X[\\mu]$ can be derived from the DTFT by sampling $X(e^{j \\Omega})$ at $\\Omega = \\mu \\frac{2 \\pi}{N}$. The DTFT $X(e^{j \\Omega})$ is sampled in the range of $0 \\leq \\Omega < 2 \\pi$. Since the DTFT is periodic with a period of $2 \\pi$, it can be conluded that the DTFT $X(e^{j \\Omega})$ for $\\pi < \\Omega < 2 \\pi$ is equal to the DTFT for $-\\pi < \\Omega < 0$. It follows, that the DFT $X[\\mu]$ for $\\frac{N}{2} < \\mu \\leq (N-1)$ is equal to the sampled DTFT for [negative normalized angular frequencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_frequency) $-\\pi < \\Omega < 0$. The resulting normalized frequency axis of the DFT is illustrated for the case of an even length ($N=10$)\n",

    "![Frequency axes of the DFT](DFT_axis.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For a discrete signal which has been derived by sampling from a continuous signal $x[k] = x(k T)$, the normalized angular frequency $\\Omega$ can be related to the frequency $f$ by $\\Omega = 2 \\pi \\frac{f}{f_\\text{s}}$, where $T$ and $f_\\text{s} = \\frac{1}{T}$ denote the sampling interval and frequency, respectively. The lowest axis illustrates the resulting frequency axis. It can be concluded that the first half of the spectrum represents the complex values of $X[\\mu]$ for increasing positive frequencies, while the second half represents the complex values for decreasing negative frequencies. This structure has to be kept in mind when interpreting a DFT.\n",
