    "## Fast Convolution\n",
    "\n",
    "The linear convolution of signals is a basic building block in many practical applications. The straightforward convolution of two finite-length signals $x[k]$ and $h[k]$ has considerable numerical complexity. This has led to the development of various algorithms that realize the convolution with lower complexity. The basic concept of the *fast convolution* is to exploit the [convolution theorem](theorems.ipynb#Convolution-Theorem) of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). This theorem states that the periodic convolution of two signals is equal to a scalar multiplication of their spectra. The scalar multiplication has considerably less numerical operations that the convolution. The transformation of the signals can be performed efficiently by the [fast Fourier transform](fast_fourier_transform.ipynb) (FFT). \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the scalar multiplication of the spectra realizes a periodic convolution, special care has to be taken to realize a linear convolution in the spectral domain. The equivalence between linear and periodic convolution is discussed in the following."

    "The algorithm requires two DFTs of length $M$, $M$ complex multiplications and one IDFT of length $M$. On first sight this does not seem to be an improvement, since one DFT/IDFT requires $M^2$ complex multiplications and $M \\cdot (M-1)$ complex additions. The overall numerical complexity is hence in the order of $\\mathcal{O}(M^2)$. The DFT can be realized efficiently by the [fast Fourier transformation](fast_fourier_transform.ipynb) (FFT), which lowers the number of numerical operations for each DFT/IDFT significantly. The actual gain depends on the particular implementation of the FFT. Many FFTs are most efficient for lengths which are a power of two. It therefore can make sense, in terms of the number of numerical operations, to choose $M$ as a power of two instead of the shortest possible length $N+L-1$. In this case, the numerical complexity of the radix-2 algorithm is on the order of $\\mathcal{O}(M \\log_2 M)$.\n",
