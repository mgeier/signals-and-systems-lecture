    "Certain [signals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_%28electrical_engineering%29) play an important role in the theory and practical application of [signal processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_processing). They emerge from the theory of signals and systems, are used to characterize the properties of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems or frequently occur in practical applications. These standard signals are introduced and illustrated in the following. The treatise is limited to one-dimensional deterministic time- and amplitude-continuous signals."

The Dirac impulse is denoted as $\\delta(t)$. The Dirac delta function can be defined as the limiting case of other functions or by its effect on other functions. Please refer to the literature for a detailed discussion of the mathematical foundations of the Dirac delta distribution. For its application in signal processing it is suitable to consider only certain properties. The most relevant properties of the Dirac impulse in the context of signals and systems are\n",
