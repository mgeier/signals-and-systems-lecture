Note that the signal nor its spectrum are absolutely integrable. However, the invertibilty still holds as is shown by evaluating the [integral of the inverse DTFT](definition.ipynb#Definition). Since the integration is only performed in the range $\\Omega = -\\pi$ to $\\pi$, it is sufficient to consider a single Dirac impulse $2 \\pi \\cdot \\delta(\\Omega - \\Omega_0)$ instead of the Dirac comb for the computation."
