    "The [phase and group delay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_delay_and_phase_delay) characterize the phase and delay properties of an LTI system. Both quantify the frequency dependent delay that is imprinted on a signal when passing through a system. In many applications the delay introduced by a system should be as small as possible or within reasonable limits."

The phase delay quantifies the delay of a single harmonic exponential signal $e^{j \\omega} $ with frequency $\\omega$ when passing through the system. The negative sign in the definition of the phase delay results in a positive phase delay $t_p(\\omega) > 0$ when a signal is delayed by a system. Note that the phase delay may not be defined for $\\omega = 0$."

The negative sign in above definition results in a positive group delay for a system imposing a delay onto the input signal. Note that the [phase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instantaneous_phase) $\\varphi(j \\omega)$ is in general only unique for $- \\pi < \\varphi(j \\omega) \\leq \\pi$. If the phase exceeds this range it is wrapped back. For meaningful results it is required to unwrap the phase before computing the group delay."
