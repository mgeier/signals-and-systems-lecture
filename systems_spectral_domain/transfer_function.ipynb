    "## The Transfer Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Different time-domain representations can be used to characterize linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. For instance, the constant coefficients of ordinary partial differential equations (ODEs), the [impulse response](../systems_time_domain/impulse_response.ipynb) and the [step response](../systems_time_domain/step_response.ipynb). The [transfer function](../systems_time_domain/eigenfunctions.ipynb#Transfer-Function) denotes the complex factor $H(s)$ an eigenfunction $e^{s t}$ at the input of an LTI system is weighted with when passing through the system. Since the Laplace transform decomposes signals with respect to these eigenfunctions, the transfer function constitutes a representation in the spectral (Fourier or Laplace) domain. The links between the transfer function and the time-domain characterizations of LTI systems are discussed in this section."

Rules for the asymptotic behavior of the magnitude and phase for single poles and zeros are available in the [literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bode_plot#Rules_for_handmade_Bode_plot). For instance it is stated that a single pole/zero results in a magnitude response in the bode plot that decreases/increases with a slope of 20 dB per decade. These rules provide insights into the influence of the location and order of poles and zeros on the properties of systems. They are of benefit when designing systems with given magnitude and phase properties."
