    "The Fourier domain transfer function $H(j \\omega)$ characterizes the transmission properties of a linear time-incariant (LTI) system with respect to the [harmonic exponential signal](../continuous_signals/standard_signals.ipynb#Complex-Exponential-Signal) $e^{j \\omega t}$ for the angular frequency $\\omega = 2 \\pi f$. In order to illustrate the characteristics of an LTI system, often the magnitude $| H(j \\omega) |$ and phase $\\varphi_H(j \\omega)$ of the transfer function is regarded separately. Decomposing the output signal $Y(j \\omega) = X(j \\omega) \\cdot H(j \\omega)$ into its magnitude $| Y(j \\omega) |$ and phase $\\varphi_Y(j \\omega)$ yields\n",

    "where $X(j \\omega)$ denotes the input signal, and $| X(j \\omega) |$ and $\\varphi_X(j \\omega)$ its magnitude and phase, respectively. It can be concluded from above equations, that the magnitude $| H(j \\omega) |$ provides the frequency-dependent attenuation of the magnitude $| X(j \\omega) |$ of the input signal by the system, while $\\varphi_H(j \\omega)$ provides the introduced phase-shift. \n",
    "\n",
    "A common graphical illustration of the sytem properties in terms of the magnitude and phase of the transfer function are [*bode plots*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bode_plot). Here the logarithmic magnitude of the transfer function $20 \\log_{10} | H(j \\omega) |$ in [decibels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel) is plotted against the logarithm of the frequency $\\omega$ or $f$. The phase $\\varphi_H(j \\omega)$ is plotted linearly against the logarithm of the frequency. A transfer function $H(s)$ which is a rational function in $s$ can be represented [in terms of its poles and zeros](../laplace_transform/definition.ipynb#Representation). Applying this representation to the transfer function $H(j \\omega)$ in the Fourier domain yields\n",

    "where $\\arg(\\cdot)$ denotes the [argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_%28complex_analysis%29) (phase) of a complex function. It can be concluded from above result, that the individual contributions of the poles and zeros to the bode plot can be superimposed. This fact can be exploited to manually draw approximated bode plots illustrating the properties of an LTI system for a given set of poles and zeros. Rules for the asymptotic behavior of the magnitude and phase for single poles and zeros are available in the [literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bode_plot#Rules_for_handmade_Bode_plot). For instance it is stated that a single pole/zero results in a magnitude response in the bode plot that decreases/increases with a slope of 20 dB per decade. These rules provide insights into the influence of the location and order of poles and zeros on the properties of systems. They are of benefit when designing systems with given magnitude and phase properties."
