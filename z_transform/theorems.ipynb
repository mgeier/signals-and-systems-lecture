    "The theorems of the $z$-transform relate basic operations applied to discrete signals to their equivalents in the spectral domain. They are of use for the computation of $z$-transforms of signals composed from modified [standard signals](../continuous_signals/standard_signals.ipynb) and for the computation of the response of systems to an input signal. The theorems allow further to predict the consequences of modifying a signal or system by certain operations."

The output signal $y[k]$ of an LTI system is given as the convolution of the input signal $x[k]$ with its impulse response $h[k]$. The signals and their relation can be represented alternatively in the spectral domain using the convolution theorem. This leads to the following two equivalent representations of an LTI system\n",

In many cases this procedure simplifies the calculation of the system response significantly. The convolution theorem can also be useful to derive a $z$-transform. The key is here to express the signal as convolution of two other signals for which the $z$-transforms are known. This is illustrated by the following example."
