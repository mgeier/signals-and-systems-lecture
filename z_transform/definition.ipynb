    "The [$z$-transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-transform), as the [discrete-time Fourier transform](../discrete_time_fourier_transform/definition.ipynb) (DTFT), is a transform which represents a discrete signal $x[k]$ in the spectral domain. Unlike the DTFT which uses the harmonic complex exponential function $e^{-j \\Omega k}$ with $\\Omega \\in \\mathbb{R}$ as kernel, the $z$-transformation bases on the complex exponential function $z^{-k}$ with $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ as kernel."
