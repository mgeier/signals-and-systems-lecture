    "Periodic signals are an import class of signals. Many practical signals can be approximated reasonably well as periodic functions. The latter holds often when considering only a limited time-interval. Examples for periodic signals are a superposition of harmonic signals, signals captured from vibrating structures or rotating machinery, as well as speech signals or signals from musical instruments. The spectrum of a periodic signal exhibits specific properties which are derived in the following."
