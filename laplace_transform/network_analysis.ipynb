    "The Laplace transform is a well-established tool for the analysis of differential equations including initial values. [Electrical networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_network) composed of linear passive elements, like resistors, capacitors and inductors can be described mathematically by linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with constant coefficients. The Laplace transform provides an elegant way of analyzing such networks."

    "It was assumed that the voltage $u(t)=0$ and current $i(t)=0$ for $t < 0$, hence that both are causal signals. The initial values $u(0+)$ and $i(0+)$ denote the right-sided limit values for $t=0$. For instance $u(0+) = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0} u(0 + \\epsilon)$. They initial values represent the energy stored in the capacitors and inductors at time instant $t=0$, respectively. The analysis of a passive electrical network is perfomed by applying [Kirchhoff's circuit laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff's_circuit_laws) resulting in an ODE, describing for instance the relation between input and output voltage. This ODE has to be solved explicitly. See for instance a [previous example](../systems_time_domain/network_analysis.ipynb).\n",

The results are summarized in the third column. The differentiation and integration are now represented by linear operations. Kirchhoff's circuit laws can be applied straighforward to the transformed quantities using the transformed relations. This is due to the fact that the Laplace transform is a linear operation. The result is an algebraic equation that can be solved straightforward with respect to the desired quantities.\n",
