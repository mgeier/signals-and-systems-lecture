    "\n",
    "So far only the [(forward) Laplace transform](definition.ipynb) has been introduced. The Laplace transform features also an [inverse transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_Laplace_transform). The inverse Laplace transform maps a complex-valued Laplace transform $X(s) \\in \\mathbb{C}$ with complex-valued independent variable $s \\in \\mathbb{C}$ into the complex-valued signal $x(t) \\in \\mathbb{C}$ with real-valued independent variable $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. It can be shown that the inverse Laplace transform $x(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\{ X(s) \\}$ is uniquely determined for most practically relevant signals. This section discusses two different techniques for the computation of the inverse Laplace transform."

    "### Rational Laplace Transforms\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing the inverse Laplace transform by above integral formula can be challenging. The [Cauchy residue theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residue_theorem) provides a practically tractable solution for Laplace transforms $X(s) = \\mathcal{L} \\{ x(t) \\}$ which are given as rational functions. It states that the value of a line integral of an holomorphic function over a closed contour is given by summing up its [residues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residue_theorem). The residue is the value of the line integral for a path enclosing a singularity. Consequently, the inverse Laplace transform of a rational Laplace transform can be computed by summing up the individual contributions from its poles. This procedure is detailed in the following."
