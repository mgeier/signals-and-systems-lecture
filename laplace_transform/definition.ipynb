    "\n",
    "The [Laplace transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_transform), as the [Fourier transform](../fourier_transform/definition.ipynb), is an integral transform which represents a signal $x(t)$ in the frequency domain. Unlike the Fourier transform which uses the harmonic complex exponential function $e^{j \\omega t}$ with $\\omega \\in \\mathbb{R}$ as kernel, the Laplace transformation bases on the complex exponential function $e^{s t}$ with $s \\in \\mathbb{C}$ as kernel. The Laplace transform is named after its discoverer [Pierre-Simon Laplace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Simon_Laplace)."
